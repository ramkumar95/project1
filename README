# Kubernetes Web Application with MySQL Database

This README provides an overview and setup instructions for a Kubernetes project that deploys a web application (jtrac) and a MySQL database.

## Overview

This Kubernetes project is designed to demonstrate the deployment of a web application and a MySQL database within a Kubernetes cluster. The web application is accessible externally via a NodePort service, while the MySQL database is made available internally using a ClusterIP service.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- Docker installed on your local machine for building and pushing container images
- Necessary Kubernetes tools like `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
- Any specific dependencies required by your web application or MySQL database

## Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the web application and MySQL database:

### Deploying MySQL

1. Create a Kubernetes deployment for MySQL, specifying the desired configuration, environment variables, and secrets.

2. Ensure that the MySQL deployment is running successfully within your cluster.

### Deploying Web Application (jtrac)

1. Create a Kubernetes deployment for your web application (jtrac) with the required configurations and environment variables.

2. Expose the web application using a NodePort service, making it accessible externally.

3. Verify that the web application pod is running and the service is correctly configured.

## Accessing the Application

To access the deployed web application, use the following URL: `http://<node-ip>:<node-port>`, where `<node-ip>` is the IP address of one of your Kubernetes nodes, and `<node-port>` is the NodePort configured for the service.

## Configuration

For any custom configurations or modifications, refer to the respective deployment YAML files or Helm charts for guidance.

## Security

Ensure that proper security measures are in place, including authentication and authorization for MySQL, as well as network policies to control traffic within the cluster.

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track the performance and behavior of your application and database. Consider using tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and Elasticsearch and Kibana for logging.

## Backup and Recovery

Set up a backup and recovery strategy for the MySQL database to prevent data loss. Explore options such as regular backups and automated recovery procedures.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment or while accessing the application, refer to the troubleshooting section of the documentation or seek assistance from the project team.
